# CodeShark Backend
  Backend part of the project for "Software Engineering" course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)

All code is inside the **"Izvorni Kod"** directory.

Instructions for running the backend locally are in **IzvorniKod/README.md**.
The project has a config example file which can be configured to another project with the code from **codeshark_config.py** or manually.
